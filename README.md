## COVID 19 Shiny app 

The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic.

The aim of this app is to display the latest worldwide information about the virus, and show its temporal evolution in each country.
Plenty of webpages about this topic already exist. For example:

The data is gathered from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and it is updated at least once a day.



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/DanielLapido/Assignment6/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
